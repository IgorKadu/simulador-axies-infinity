# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

This project was created to provide Axie Infinity players with powerful tools to gain a competitive edge. The game has a complex meta that is constantly evolving, and success requires deep understanding of game mechanics, team compositions, and strategic decision-making. By providing accurate battle simulators and data analysis tools, we empower players to test theories, refine strategies, and make informed decisions without the need for extensive trial and error in the actual game.

## Problems It Solves

- **High Barrier to Entry:** New players can be overwhelmed by the complexity of the game. Our tools help them learn the mechanics and understand what makes a good team.
- **Inefficient Strategy Testing:** Testing new team compositions and strategies in-game can be time-consuming and costly. The simulators provide a free and instant way to experiment.
- **Meta-Game Analysis:** The project helps players stay on top of the ever-changing meta by identifying which Axies, cards, and team setups are currently performing well.

## How It Should Work

The project should consist of a backend for data processing and simulation, and a frontend for user interaction.
- **Backend:** Python-based, using Flask for a simple API to serve simulation results. It will handle parsing game data, running simulations, and storing results.
- **Frontend:** A web-based dashboard built with a modern JavaScript framework (like Vue or React) to allow users to build teams, run simulations, and view detailed reports and analytics.

## User Experience Goals

- **Intuitive:** The interface should be easy to navigate for both new and experienced players.
- **Informative:** Results should be presented clearly, with visualizations and detailed breakdowns of battle events.
- **Fast:** Simulations should run quickly to allow for rapid iteration and testing.
- **Comprehensive:** The tools should cover both Axie Infinity Classic and Origin, with up-to-date game data.
